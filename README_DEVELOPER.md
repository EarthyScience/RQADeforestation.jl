# Welcome to RQADeforestation.jl

This README collects important information for local development of the package.

# Local setup

Install `just` into your system, following its README [installation instructions](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

Then run
```bash
just init
```
This will for instance setup pre-commit to enforce the standard Julia styling [blue](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/BlueStyle).
